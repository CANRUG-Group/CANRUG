      "description": "At last year's ELUNA, the Western Canadian Ex Libris User Group (WCELUG) welcomed participants from libraries across Canada. Through this meeting, we collaboratively decided to transition to the Canadian Regional User Group (CANRUG). Since then, significant progress has been made to formalize this transition. This session will be the first ELUNA meeting for CANRUG. Join us to learn about the progress we've made in transitioning to a nationwide user group, including newly drafted by-laws, the CANRUG website, and the CANRUG mailing list.<br><br><a href=\"https://elunaconf2025.dryfta.com/program-schedule/program/detail/127/canadian-regional-user-group-meeting\" target=\"_blank\">Canadian Regional User Group Meeting</a>",
